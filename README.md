# Practical 2

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Create Android Application to demonstrate functions of Activity Life Cycle and Basic UI.

## ðŸ“– Description
This practical demonstrates the Activity Life Cycle in Android along with the creation of a basic user interface (UI).
An Android Activity passes through multiple states such as onCreate, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, and onDestroy.
By overriding these callback methods and displaying messages (e.g., using Toast or Logcat), we can observe how the Activity behaves during different events like app launch, switching to another app, or closing the app.
