# Practical 2

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Create Android Application to demonstrate functions of Activity Life Cycle and Basic UI.

## ðŸ“– Description
This practical demonstrates the Activity Life Cycle in Android along with the creation of a basic user interface (UI).
An Android Activity passes through multiple states such as onCreate, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, and onDestroy.
By overriding these callback methods and displaying messages (e.g., using Toast or Logcat), we can observe how the Activity behaves during different events like app launch, switching to another app, or closing the app.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots with Description  

| Screenshot | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| ![App Launch](https://github.com/RIDHAMPATEL132/MAD_23012021041_Practical2/blob/master/screenshot/simple.png) |When the application is launched, the initial screen displays a simple **"Hello World!"** text on a yellow background. This demonstrates the **basic UI layout** created in Android Studio.|
| ![Toast Message Screenshot](https://github.com/RIDHAMPATEL132/MAD_23012021041_Practical2/blob/master/screenshot/toast_msg.png) | When the Activity moves to a new state, a **Toast message** appears showing which life cycle method is executed (e.g., `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`). |
| ![Logcat Screenshot](https://github.com/RIDHAMPATEL132/MAD_23012021041_Practical2/blob/master/screenshot/logcat.png) | The **Logcat output** clearly shows the sequence of Activity Life Cycle methods being called, such as `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, and `onDestroy()`.  |

## âœ… Result
Final result or conclusion of this practical.
